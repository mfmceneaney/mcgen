# Monte Carlo Generation with Worm Algorithm

Monte Carlo Generation uses classes defined in `mclib.py` and can be run with the script `generateMC.py`.  An example job script `job.sh` is provided.
The code uses the python package Numba to increase computational speed.

Analysis of the generated data is done with classes defined in `analysislib.py`.  The plots and data tables for the various parts of the project may be created with the corresponding `project*_part*.py` scripts.

Exact solution of the Hamiltonian for part 1 of the project is done using the classes in `exactlib.py` and can be run with `project1_part1.py`.
